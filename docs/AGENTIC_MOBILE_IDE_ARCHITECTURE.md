# Mobile Harness — Agentic Mobile IDE Architecture

## Current architecture audit

Mobile Harness is an Android application with applicationId `com.jarves.mh`.

- Kotlin + Jetpack Compose UI.
- AndroidX lifecycle/ViewModel state ownership.
- MainActivity owns the Compose entry point and theme.
- MainViewModel currently coordinates application state, projects, chats, runtime sessions, GitHub, skills, terminal, changes and recovery.
- Runtime work is kept outside the Compose process through Android foreground services.
- RuntimeExecutionService owns the long-running task notification, stop action and bounded wake lock.
- RuntimeSetupService owns Linux/runtime installation and setup progress.
- Android notification permission is already declared.
- The app uses an ARM64-only runtime because the embedded Linux execution environment is ARM64.

### Local Linux execution boundary

Compose UI -> MainViewModel -> RuntimeBridge -> RuntimeInstaller/PRoot -> Linux agent process -> workspace

The Android process owns orchestration and UX state. The Linux environment is the execution substrate for coding agents.

### Agent abstraction

RuntimeBridge is the provider-neutral execution contract. Antigravity has explicit session recovery support because its provider conversation ID can be preserved.

Provider credentials/session state remain owned by the respective runtime/provider; Mobile Harness should not scrape or duplicate provider credentials.

### Workspace/change review

WorkspaceCheckpoints snapshots the workspace before an agent task, computes file-level diffs afterward, and supports Undo/Keep at task/file level. Internal runtime directories are excluded from project diffs.

### Persistence

Project/chat/setup state is stored in Android app-private files/preferences/JSON. Runtime assets and workspaces are also app-private. IDE state must remain Android-owned and survive Linux runtime process restarts.

## Architectural rule

Do not turn MainViewModel into a larger god-object. Introduce explicit domain services:

- ProjectIndex — file/symbol/search index.
- ContextEngine — ranks project context for an agent request.
- AgentSessionManager — session lifecycle/checkpoints/resume.
- ToolPermissionManager — tool approval/policy.
- CommandRegistry — command palette.
- NotificationCoordinator — in-app + Android system notification abstraction.
- ProjectMemoryStore — durable project instructions/decisions.
- CheckpointStore — multi-checkpoint history.
- GitWorkspaceService — git status/branch/diff/commit/push/PR operations.
- SkillManager — portable Agent Skills registry.
- McpToolRegistry — future MCP discovery/permission/runtime integration.
- TestRunner — build/test/lint execution through the Linux runtime.
- AgentOrchestrator — future plan/implement/test/review loop.

UI composables should consume state exposed by these services rather than implement business logic themselves.

## Six-phase implementation target

### Phase 1 — IDE foundation
- production code editor
- syntax highlighting
- line numbers
- search/replace

### Phase 2 — Agent intelligence
- repository/file index
- symbol index
- import/dependency relationships
- relevance-ranked context
- project memory
- AGENTS.md/rules loading
- Plan mode
- durable checkpoints

### Phase 3 — Agentic development
- build/test execution
- structured test results
- failure diagnosis
- bounded self-repair loop
- debugging/deep links from stack traces
- detailed agent activity timeline

### Phase 4 — AI ecosystem
- portable Skills
- MCP tool registry
- provider/model routing
- multi-agent orchestration
- tool permission policies
- secure approval UX

### Phase 5 — Mobile-first capabilities
- background agent jobs
- resumable sessions
- intelligent Android notifications
- voice commands
- offline-first project/editor state
- mobile command center

### Phase 6 — Advanced IDE
- browser/research tool
- visual preview inspection
- screenshot-aware UI iteration
- AI code review
- dependency intelligence
- AI commit/PR generation
- extension architecture

## Notification architecture

Use two separate notification planes.

### Local Android notifications — default

Agent event -> NotificationCoordinator -> Android NotificationManager

Use this for task started, progress, approval required, task completed, task failed, tests, network recovery exhaustion, and runtime setup results.

The existing foreground-service notification remains the required Android runtime notification and should be upgraded rather than replaced.

### Optional FCM remote notifications

FCM is only needed when a future backend needs to notify a device when the app/runtime is not the source of the event. FCM must not replace local runtime notifications.

No provider OAuth/session token should be reused as Firebase credentials.

## Firebase security rule

`google-services.json` is Android Firebase configuration, not a server credential. Never put a Firebase service-account private-key JSON in the APK, Git repository, or Linux runtime bundle.

If server-side FCM sending is added later, credentials belong on a trusted server or Cloud Function using ADC/service-account credentials.

## Android/Linux boundary

The Linux environment emits structured events: tool started/completed, file changed, command started/completed, build/test result, agent message, session state, and failure/recovery state.

Android translates those events into UI state, checkpoints/diffs, notifications, persistence, permissions, and navigation/deep links.

This prevents Linux process restarts from destroying Android UX state.

## UX quality requirements

Every new component must use the existing Material 3 theme and spacing system, respect edge-to-edge and IME insets, avoid unnecessary overlays, avoid floating controls covering content, keep touch targets accessible, avoid duplicate toolbars, use semantic icons/content descriptions, make destructive actions explicit, and preserve state across recreation where appropriate.

No feature is complete if it only works as a demo or mock.

## Completion criteria

A phase is complete only when production implementation exists, no placeholder/stub/demo implementation remains, persistence/recovery behavior is defined, Android/Linux boundaries are respected, UI is integrated into existing navigation/theme, tests cover core behavior, build/lint/test are executed where the environment permits, and changed files/known limitations are reported.
